\section{Repetition/Introduction to Simulink/QuaRC}\label{sec:prob1}

This part is just a repetition, and therefore does not contain any important results. However, the part is important because it is used to test the hardware setup at the lab. This was done using a handed out script that made the helicopter hover at zero elevation and zero pitch. The helicopter suffered from minor drifting as a result of not perfectly tuned motor constants in the handed out script. This was expected and does not really introduce any problem since the drifting would be eliminated as soon as some form of feedback was implemented.
